	  <h2>Why Use Github?</h2>
	  <p>
	    W3C groups have been moving to use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for reasons including:
	  </p>
	    <ul>
		    <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Github uses <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for version control. This means group members, editors, chairs and the public can easily track and find changes to specifications and other work, refer and rollback to these edits when necessary</li>
		    <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Github provides a clean UI for version control and issue management, making it easy for members to use and follow</li>
		    <li><strong >Issues:</strong> Every Github repository has an issues section. Members can open issues, discuss them, assign them to individuals and label issues for projects and topics. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/payment-request/issues">PaymentRequest</a> gives a good example of well managed Github issues.</li>
		    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Github can send notifications when issues have been discussed, pull requests have been accepted and other general actions have been completed. Guidelines on how to change your notifcation settings can be found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/choosing-the-types-of-notifications-you-receive/">here</a>.</li>
		    <li><strong>Integration with W3C Systems:</strong> Some groups and members like to receive their Github notifications via W3C mailing lists. See guidelines on how to do this on the <a href="faq.html">faq</a> page.</li>	    
		    <li><strong>Global Access:</strong> Github is available around the world and in 日本語 (Japanese), Français (French), Српски (Serbian), Deutsch (German), Svenska (Swedish), Hrvatski (Croatian), Polski (Polish) and Nederlands (Dutch). Github is currently is not blocked in any country, guidelines for country-based and corporate blocks can be found in the <a href="faq.html">faq</a> page. 
		    <li><strong>Improved Group Management:</strong> being a chair, team contact and W3C member is hard! Github makes management of our W3C tasks easier by grouping our pull requests and issues, sending us notifications, having a clear UI and managing versions.</li>
	    </ul> 
	
	    <p>
		    If you have any suggestions or issues related to the use of Github please raise them in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/w3c.github.io/issues">issues</a> section of this repository.
	    </p>    
	    
	    <p>
			Below are some guidelines on getting started and using Github in your W3C group.
		</p>
    </section>
	<section>
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<section>
		  	<p>
		   		Working on Github requires a Github account, set this up by going to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. An email is required to register, but if you wish you do not need to share any other personal information with Github. Once registered, you should be able to make new repositories which are attached to your account. 
		  	</p>
		  	<h3>Create an informal draft using your personal account</h3>
		      <p>
		        Getting started individually obviously doesn't require any approval process, so there's no need for you to check with chairs or members before getting started. Start a new repo using your account, and create an informal draft. We recommend using <a href="https://github.com/w3c/respec">ReSpec</a>, Respec is a tool which can help make W3C drafts easily. We strongly recommend one repository per document, unless you really know why you're doing it differently.
		      </p>
		      <p>
		        You can just publish HTML as you normally would simply by setting up
		        <a href="https://github.com/blog/2228-simpler-github-pages-publishing">GitHub Pages</a>
		        to use the default branch, <code>master</code>. Github Pages should allow you to see the draft document hosted via Github. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			    Let the group know you have created an informal draft and share the link to your new repo under your account. The group can then discuss whether to bring this into the group as an official First Public Working Draft. 
		      </p>
		    </section>
		    <section>
		      <h3>Host the repository within the <code>w3c</code> organisation</h3>
		      <p>
			    The <a href="https://github.com/w3c">W3C</a> main Github oragnisation account will hold all the repos for W3C specifications and W3C Team projects. Once a group has accepted a document as a First Public Working Draft the document may become eligible for being moved to the main W3C account. Before this happens, make sure the draft owner(s) are identifiable by either by name or by e-mail address. Community Groups should refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/cg-support/#what">the Guidebook for Community Groups</a> for more information relating to their documents.
		      </p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>
		          Your Team Contact should be a part of the
		          <a href="https://github.com/organizations/w3c/settings/owners">Owners Team</a> of the W3C
		          organisation. (W3C Staff: ask any of the current owners directly for access, or ask on &amp;sysreq.)
		        </li>
		        <li>
		          If there is no GitHub team roughly matching the group that will be pushing to that
		          repository, the Team Contact should create a new team for the editors who will be
		          contributing to the document, and give that team push and pull access.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		          W3C staff (or Team Contacts of the group) create a new repository for each document
		          (each deliverable, it can of course contain multiple resources).
		          Add each such repository to the GitHub team so that the contributors
		          all have push access. Other people can suggest changes by submitting pull requests (in
		          fact, editors can do that too to enable reviewing before commits, if desired), but not
		          every contributor will be given direct commit access.
		        </li>
		      </ol>		  
		      <p>
			      Staff can see the <a href="faq.html">faq</a> page for detailed steps for staff contacts on creating a repo.
