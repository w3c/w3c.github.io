  <p>
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a popular, open-source distributed version control
    system, commonly used with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> as a convenient central host
    of repositories, along with wiki documentation, pull request management and issue tracking.
    Several W3C groups are using GitHub infrastructure for specification and test authoring
    workflows. Below we include some suggested steps for getting started and answers to some
    frequently asked questions about using GitHub for W3C spec work.

      <h3>Detailed steps <em>for staff contacts</em> to create a repo</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The preferred way to create new repositories is by using
          <a href="https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/">ash-nazg</a>, in particular this page:
          <a href="https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/repo/new"><code>labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/repo/new</code></a>.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Follow the instructions below only if for some reason you can't use ash-nazg for this.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Let's say you're working on the unicorn spec. You head to <a
          href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a> (which is linked as "New
          repository" from the home page). Under Owner you pick "w3c" (which you should have access
          to, if not ask someone on IRC) and under repo name you pick "unicorn". Enter a
          description, keep it public, initialise with a README, don't pick a .gitignore or a
          license.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to create a new team, go to <a
          href="https://github.com/organizations/w3c/teams/new">https://github.com/organizations/w3c/teams/new</a>.
          Give the team a name ("Unicorn Editors") and grant them "Push &amp; Pull" (no need for
          admin). Save the team. Under "Members", just start typing the user names for the editors,
          you'll get a drop down suggesting people. Once you've added them all, under repository
          start typing "unicorn" and you should see w3c/unicorn listed. Pick that.
        </li>
        <li>
          That will give you a <code>https://github.com/w3c/unicorn</code> with fully configured
          access.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h2>W3C Integration</h2>

      <h3>Github and W3C mailing list</h3>
      <p>
        To have notification to the mail list at opening of new bugs/issues and modification of
        existing ones from GitHub, you may use the <a
        href="https://github.com/dontcallmedom/github-notify-ml/">github notification solution</a>
        designed by Dominique Hazael-Massieux.

      <h3>Contributor Management</h3>
      <p>
        If you wish to accept pull requests from potentially arbitrary contributors but you need to
        ensure that they have signed up to the IPR terms, see the
        <a href="repo-management.html">Contributor Management</a> section.

    <h2>Global Access</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
         Github is currently not blocked in any country, but this sometimes changes. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_GitHub">Censorship of Github</a> on Wikipedia for up to date details on Github blocks. If you reside in a country which is blocking Wikipedia please ask your group chair to provide you with information on Github blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
	      Not having access to Github will make work difficult but not impossible. Chairs should be prepared to share Github held repositories with their members in countries which do not have access to Github at any one period. The chair can clone the repo, and send this via any method with a member in a blocked country. That member will need to have git installed on their local system, then they can branch, edit and commit to that repo and send this back to the group for merging with the main Github-held repository. This is not ideal, but is an adequate work-around. For other possible methods please consult your group chair. 
      </p>    
      <p>
	      Some corporate firewalls may block Github. In these instances, members should clone or pull Github repos when they are not on their corporate firewalls, branch and edit, and then pull request once they are off their corporate network again. Any W3C member organisation should consider removing Github from their firewall settings.

      <h3>How do we ensure archiving of work done on GitHub?</h3>
      <p>
        As usual, publication of Working Drafts and Recommendations into w3.org/TR/ will be done by
        your Group by copying snapshots which satisfy pubrules into the appropriate space, with
        W3C-guaranteed archiving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Git itself decentralises archiving of every change (every user clones all history),
        backups of version history of Git repositories are straightforward (since in fact every user
        of the repository has a backup). A specific tool to maintain a full backup of the W3C
        organisation is being developed, called <a
        href="https://github.com/w3c/gh-backup">gh-backup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content that is not part of the repositories themselves (issues, wikis, pull requests, etc.)
        are backed up as events to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/pheme">Pheme</a> system (for
        the whole organisation). A Pheme instance is currently running in beta at the
        <a href="https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/pheme/">Hatchery Pheme instance</a>; and some of the
        recent events can be viewed in the <a href="https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/midgard/">Hatchery
        Midgard instance</a>. The full data can be made exploitable as it is all sorted and
        indexable.

      <h3>When should we use Git/GitHub as opposed to w3.org-hosted CVS or Mercurial?</h3>
      <p>
        It's up to your group to decide, but using anything other than git is generally considered
        cruel and unusual. You can use git without using GitHub of course, but GitHub tends to be
        where a group's community resides which makes it easier to get contributions. Also, a lot of
        the W3C's more recent tooling assumes GitHub.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Should we use GitHub for issue management too?</h3>
      <p>
        Issue-management tooling is entirely up to groups to choose. That being said, the same notes
        apply as for the previous question: if you wish to communicate with a broader community,
        GitHub is usually the better option.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How do we manage IPR with specs authored on GitHub?</h3>
      <p>
        In general, in the same way as for any other contribution intake mechanism. GitHub only
        tends to be singled out because it often leads to more contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="repo-management.html">Contributor Management</a> for a tool that is available
        to automate that process.

      <h3>What shall I do about trolls and spam on GitHub?</h3>
      <p>
        GitHub staff are usually quick to respond to spam or uncivic behaviour on their platform.
        When a particular GitHub account is repeatedly causing trouble in a W3C repository, a good
        first step is to <strong>report the account</strong> to GitHub.
        To do so, go to that user's profile page (eg, <code>https://github.com/supertroll</code>),
        click &ldquo;Block or report user&rdquo;, and then &ldquo;Report abuse&rdquo;.
        If after a while the account is not suspended by GitHub and spam persists, it is possible
        to <strong>block the account</strong> to prevent all interaction with the repository in
        the future.
        (<a href="mailto:sysreq@w3.org">Write W3C's sysreq</a> if you don't have permissions to
        block the account yourself.)
