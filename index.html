    Most W3C groups use Github to manage their work and develop specifications. This site contains guidelines and a list of resources for using GitHub with W3C projects.
    The following links should help you find your way.
    Refer to the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for details about the breadth and scope of W3C projects.

      W3C Groups use Github for spec development and easy group and task management. Find out <a href="usinggithub.html">here</a> why groups use Github, and understand the general W3C group <a href="usinggithub.html#githubflow">Github Flow</a>.

      If you are looking for a specific project that W3C maintain on GitHub (including specifications and group work), the best is to go
      straight to the list of repositories, which is searchable.

      Github's functionality is based on <code>git</code> version control. Most of the issues people have using GitHub are in fact related to <code>git</code>. General <code>git</code> and GitHub questions will not be addressed on this site.
      GitHub's own help site linked above is a very helpful resource.
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git">Stack Overflow's git questions</a> and <a href="https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">Github's git Cheat Sheet</a> are also helpful.

      In general, it is strongly recommended to use <a
      href="https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki">Echidna</a> to publish TR documents rather than the
      manual path that goes through the Webmaster (assuming of course that your document is of a
      supported type). This document explains how to set up your repository using Travis CI in order
      to automatically publish on every commit (to a given branch) and never again have to worry
      about what people used to call “heartbeat” publications. With this, you can even get rid of
      the notion of Editor's Draft altogether.

      Because work that happens on GitHub is spread out across many repositories, it can be challenging
      to remain informed about what's going on. Midgard helps there by
      filtering the data into mailboxes so that you can for instance get all the events for
      WebRTC repositories. Log in there with your W3C credentials, and just start using it. Note:
      it does not at this time have many filters and it is likely that your area of interest may not
      yet have one. If you wish to add one (which is easy) you should read
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/midgard/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#libfilterseventsjs">the
      documentation on Pheme filters</a>.
