    Many W3C work group conduct their work in Github, but not all. Please, explore our repos, watch, star, contribute.

    The purpose of this page is to progressively list the resources useful when working on
    W3C projects using GitHub.
    The following links should help you find your way.
    Refer to the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for details about the breadth and scope of W3C projects.

      If you are looking for a specific project that we maintain on GitHub, the best is to go
      straight to the list of repositories, which is searchable.<br>
      Repositories under the W3C organization may represent the work of Working Groups, Interest Groups,
      Community Groups, or Team projects, with varied status and formality. Documents and repositories should 
      maintain their own status indicators.

      Most of the issues people have using GitHub are in fact due to <code>git</code>. General
      <code>git</code> and GitHub questions will not be addressed here.
      GitHub's own help site linked above is a very helpful resource.
      You can also usually just cut and paste from
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git">Stack Overflow's git questions</a>.

      Publication from GitHub</a>

    <dd>
      In general, it is strongly recommended to use <a
      href="https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki">Echidna</a> to publish TR documents rather than the
      manual path that goes through the Webmaster (assuming of course that your document is of a
      supported type). This document explains how to set up your repository using Travis CI in order
      to automatically publish on every commit (to a given branch) and never again have to worry
      about what people used to call “heartbeat” publications. With this, you can even get rid of
      the notion of Editor's Draft altogether.

    <dd>
      Because work that happens on GitHub is spread out across many repositories, it can be challenging
      to remain informed about what's going on. Midgard helps there by
      filtering the data into mailboxes so that you can for instance get all the events for
      WebRTC repositories. Log in there with your W3C credentials, and just start using it. Note:
      it does not at this time have many filters and it is likely that your area of interest may not
      yet have one. If you wish to add one (which is easy) you should read
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/midgard/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#libfilterseventsjs">the
      documentation on Pheme filters</a>.
